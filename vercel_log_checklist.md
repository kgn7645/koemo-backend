# Vercel Deployment Log Checklist

## Key Items to Check in Vercel Logs:

### 1. Build Command Detection
Look for lines like:
- `Detected Build Command:`
- `Running "npm run build"`
- `Build Command:`
- `Executing build command`

### 2. Framework Detection
Check for:
- `Detected Framework:`
- `Auto-detected project settings`
- `Framework preset:`

### 3. Cache Messages
Look for:
- `Restoring build cache`
- `Using build cache`
- `Cache restored`
- `Build cache not found`

### 4. Package Installation
Check if it's installing packages fresh:
- `Installing dependencies`
- `npm install`
- `Lockfile found`

### 5. Actual Build Execution
Look for the exact command being run:
- The actual output of the build command
- Any TypeScript compilation messages
- Error messages mentioning `.ts` files

### 6. Git Information
Check which commit is being deployed:
- `Cloning github.com/...`
- `Commit SHA:`
- `Branch:`

## Possible Solutions:

1. **Clear Build Cache**: In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings > Advanced > Redeploy with "Clear Build Cache"

2. **Override Build Command**: In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings > General > Build & Development Settings and explicitly set:
   - Build Command: `echo "Build already completed"`
   - Output Directory: `./`

3. **Disable Framework Detection**: Add to vercel.json:
   ```json
   {
     "framework": null,
     "buildCommand": "echo 'Build already completed'"
   }
   ```

4. **Check Environment Variables**: In Vercel dashboard, check if there are any env vars like `BUILD_COMMAND` or similar that might override settings.

Please share the relevant sections of your Vercel deployment logs that match these items, and I'll help identify why it's still running the TypeScript build.
